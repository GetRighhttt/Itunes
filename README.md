# StefanBayneItunes

Use the itunes API to preview songs from Lil Wayne, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole. Everything is setup in tab layout,
and also added a search view that makes an api call to display results of artists when searched. When a track is clicked 
on, a preview of the song comes up using whichever player is desingated on your android device.
